# Bacterial-sensor-evolved-by-decreasing-complexity
Additional data for the manuscript "Bacterial sensor evolved by decreasing complexity".

1. Two pdb files: structures predicted from AlphaFold and ESMFold.
2. distal+sCache_MSA.fasta: multiple sequence alignment of dCache distal modules, including sCache that also aligned to distal modules.
3. Two nwk files: Neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood trees built from the above alignment.
4. proximal_MSA.fasta: multiple sequence alignment of dCache proximal modules.
