# Bacterial-sensor-evolved-by-decreasing-complexity
Additional data for the manuscript "Bacterial sensor evolved by decreasing complexity".

### 1. Two pdb files
   Structures of PacF sensory domain predicted from AlphaFold and ESMFold.
### 2. distal+sCache_MSA.fasta
   Multiple sequence alignment of dCache distal modules, including sCache that also aligned to this region. MSAs were built using MAFFT with default parameters.
### 3. Two nwk files
   Neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood trees built from the above alignment. Trees were built using MEGA with 100 bootstraps and default parameters.
### 4. proximal_MSA.fasta
   Multiple sequence alignment of dCache proximal modules.
